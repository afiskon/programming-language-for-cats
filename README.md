# PLFC: Programming Language For Cats

PLFC is a functional strongly-typed Docker-oriented programming language
designed to be used by cats. Most cats are not very good in programming at first
but with PLFC they learn very quickly (some cats even mastered template
metaprogramming). It should be noted that, in theory, other animals could
program PLFC as well.

Usage:

1. Compile the PLFC interpreter: `gcc plfc.c -o plfc`;
2. Run it: `./plfc`;
3. Put your cat on a keyboard;
4. Read commands from the screen and execute them;

Roadmap:

* Make sure PLFC runs not only on Linux;
* Fix a problem of platfrom-dependent behaviour during commands execution;
* Add generics;
